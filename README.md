README for Typescript React Hangman Game

Project Title: Hangman Game

Description:
This Typescript React Hangman game offers a modern take on the classic word-guessing game. Players try to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. This project showcases the use of React functional components, hooks for state management, and TypeScript for strong typing and bug reduction.

Features:

Interactive Gameplay: Users can click or type to guess letters of a hidden word.
Scalable Architecture: Utilizes TypeScript and React for easy maintenance and scalability.

Responsive Design: Compatible with desktop and mobile devices for a seamless user experience.
Visual Hangman Drawing: Progressively reveals a hangman drawing as the user makes incorrect guesses.

Score Tracking: Keeps track of the player's wins and losses across sessions.

Technologies Used:

TypeScript: Ensures type safety and enhances code quality and readability.
React: Used for building the user interface with a component-based architecture.
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the application's frontend.
